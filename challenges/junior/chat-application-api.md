# Backend Challenge - Chat Application API

## Introduction

The "Chat Application API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that supports real-time messaging between users.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for managing users, conversations, and messages.
- Handle real-time communication for instant messaging.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for a chat application.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
     - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and generate a session token.
     - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
     - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieve details about a specific user.
     - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Update user information (e.g., username, profile picture).
     - `DELETE /users/{userId}`: Delete a user account.
     - `POST /conversations`: Start a new conversation between users.
     - `GET /conversations/{conversationId}`: Retrieve messages from a specific conversation.
     - `POST /conversations/{conversationId}/message`: Send a message to a conversation.
     - `DELETE /conversations/{conversationId}/message/{messageId}`: Delete a message from a conversation.
   - Implement logic to manage user sessions, store conversations, and handle message delivery.
   - Use technologies like WebSockets or long-polling for real-time messaging capabilities.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Register new users, authenticate with login, and perform CRUD operations on users, conversations, and messages.
   - Test real-time messaging functionality to ensure messages are delivered instantly and updates are reflected in conversations.

### Possible Improvements

- **Message Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for message security.
- **Group Chats**: Extend functionality to support group conversations with multiple participants.
- **Message Status**: Add support for message status indicators (e.g., read receipts, message delivered).
- **User Presence**: Implement presence status (e.g., online, offline) for users.
- **Notifications**: Integrate with push notification services to notify users of new messages when they are offline.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Chat Application API and learn essential practices for backend development related to real-time communication and user management. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
