# Backend Challenge - CI Build and Testing Pipeline

## Introduction

The "CI Build and Testing Pipeline" challenge is designed to help you create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that integrates both build and testing stages. This pipeline ensures that your application is both built and tested automatically, providing a robust workflow for maintaining code quality.

### Objectives

- Understand the integration of build and testing stages in a CI pipeline.
- Create a CI pipeline configuration file that combines build and test processes.
- Integrate with a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to automate both stages.
- Validate that the pipeline successfully builds and tests the application.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Create a CI pipeline that automates the build and testing process for your application.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) and set up an account if you don’t have one.
   - Choose a sample application or project with build and test requirements.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **For GitHub Actions**:
     - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project.
     - Add a YAML file for the CI pipeline configuration (e.g., `ci-build-test.yml`).
     - [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) provides guidance on creating workflows.
     - [Example GitHub Actions CI for Node.js](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/node.js.yml) demonstrates setting up a pipeline with build and test stages.
   - **For GitLab CI**:
     - Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root directory of your project.
     - [GitLab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) offers details on setting up CI pipelines.
     - [Example GitLab CI for Python with Build and Test Stages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/python.html) shows how to configure build and test stages for Python projects.
   - **For Jenkins**:
     - Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of your project.
     - [Jenkins Pipeline Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) covers creating and managing Jenkins pipelines.
     - [Example Jenkinsfile for Java with Build and Test](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/examples/) provides an example of a pipeline that includes build and test stages for Java projects.

4. **Testing**:
   - Commit your CI pipeline configuration file to your repository and push it to the remote repository.
   - Verify that the CI pipeline is triggered and observe the build and test logs on your CI/CD platform’s interface.
   - Ensure that the pipeline performs the build and test stages correctly and reports any failures or errors.

### Possible Improvements

- **Deployment Integration**: Extend the pipeline to include deployment steps after successful build and tests.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Add stages for linting, static code analysis, or security scans to ensure code quality.
- **Parallel Build and Test**: Configure parallel execution to speed up the build and test process.
- **Test Coverage Reports**: Include stages for measuring and reporting test coverage.
- **Notifications**: Set up notifications to alert you of build and test results or failures.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in setting up a Continuous Integration pipeline that integrates both build and testing stages. This is a crucial skill for automating and streamlining your development workflow, ensuring that your application is continuously validated for quality. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
