# Backend Challenge - CI Build Pipeline

## Introduction

The "CI Build Pipeline" challenge is designed to help you create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline specifically for building applications. This pipeline automates the build process, ensuring that your application is consistently and correctly built each time code changes are made.

### Objectives

- Understand the basics of Continuous Integration and its role in automating builds.
- Create a CI pipeline configuration file to automate the build process.
- Integrate with a CI platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) to manage builds.
- Validate that the pipeline successfully builds the application and handles build tasks.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Create a CI pipeline that automates the build process for your application.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Choose a CI platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) and set up an account if needed.
   - Prepare a build environment that matches the requirements of your application.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **For GitHub Actions**:
     - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project.
     - Add a YAML file for the CI pipeline configuration (e.g., `ci-build.yml`).
     - [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) provides guidance on creating workflows.
     - [Example GitHub Actions Build Workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/java-maven.yml) demonstrates setting up a build pipeline for a Java Maven application.
   - **For GitLab CI**:
     - Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root directory of your project.
     - [GitLab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) offers details on setting up build pipelines.
     - [Example GitLab CI Build](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/java.html) shows how to configure a build pipeline for a Java application.
   - **For Jenkins**:
     - Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of your project.
     - [Jenkins Pipeline Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) covers creating and managing Jenkins pipelines.
     - [Example Jenkinsfile Build](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#build) provides examples of build stages for various types of projects.

4. **Testing**:
   - Commit your CI pipeline configuration file to your repository and push it to the remote repository.
   - Verify that the CI pipeline is triggered by making changes and observing the build logs on your CI platform’s interface.
   - Ensure that the pipeline correctly builds the application and handles any build tasks or dependencies.

### Possible Improvements

- **Dependency Management**: Add stages to manage and cache dependencies to speed up the build process.
- **Build Artifacts**: Configure the pipeline to store build artifacts (e.g., JAR files, binaries) for later use.
- **Parallel Builds**: Set up parallel builds to improve build times for larger projects.
- **Versioning**: Implement versioning strategies to tag build artifacts with version numbers or build IDs.
- **Notifications**: Set up notifications to alert you of build results or failures.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in setting up a Continuous Integration pipeline focused on building applications. This is an essential skill for automating and streamlining your development process, ensuring that your application is consistently built and ready for further stages of development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
