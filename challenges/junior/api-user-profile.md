# Backend Challenge - User Profile API

## Introduction

The "User Profile API" challenge is designed to build a REST API that allows basic management of user profiles, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on user profiles.
- Store user profile data (e.g., username, email, bio) persistently.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a REST API that provides functionality for managing user profiles.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for user profiles (`/profiles`):
     - `GET /profiles`: Retrieve all user profiles.
     - `POST /profiles`: Create a new user profile.
     - `GET /profiles/{userId}`: Retrieve a specific user profile by ID.
     - `PUT /profiles/{userId}`: Update an existing user profile.
     - `DELETE /profiles/{userId}`: Delete a user profile.
   - Implement logic to interact with user profile data (e.g., store in database).
   - Handle basic fields such as username, email, and bio for each user profile.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/profiles`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating user profiles).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Validation**: Implement validation for input data (e.g., email format, required fields).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests.
- **Security**: Consider security measures such as input sanitization and preventing SQL injection.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing user profiles, especially if the number of profiles grows.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses for better performance.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a User Profile API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.
