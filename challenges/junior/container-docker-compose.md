# Backend Challenge - Docker Compose

## Introduction

The "Docker Compose" challenge is designed to help you learn how to create a `docker-compose.yml` file for managing multi-container applications. Docker Compose simplifies the process of defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

### Objectives

- Understand the basics of Docker Compose and how it works.
- Learn how to create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multiple containers.
- Define services, networks, and volumes using Docker Compose.
- Run and manage your multi-container application using Docker Compose commands.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and manage a multi-container application.

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
   - Choose a sample multi-container application (e.g., a web application with a separate database).

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project.
   - Define multiple services in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Each service should correspond to a container.
   - Example `docker-compose.yml` for a web application with a database:
     
     ```yaml
     services:
       web:
         image: my-web-app:latest
         build:
           context: ./web
         ports:
           - "8080:8080"
         environment:
           - DATABASE_URL=mysql://db:3306/mydatabase
         depends_on:
           - db
         networks:
           - my-network

       db:
         image: mysql:5.7
         environment:
           MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
           MYSQL_DATABASE: mydatabase
           MYSQL_USER: user
           MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
         volumes:
           - db-data:/var/lib/mysql
         networks:
           - my-network

     volumes:
       db-data:

     networks:
       my-network:
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `version`: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
     - `services`: Defines the services (containers) for your application.
       - `web`: The service for your web application.
         - `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use.
         - `build`: Defines the build context for building the image.
         - `ports`: Maps the container’s port to the host’s port.
         - `environment`: Sets environment variables for the service.
         - `depends_on`: Specifies dependencies between services (ensures `db` starts before `web`).
         - `networks`: Connects the service to a network.
       - `db`: The service for your database.
         - `image`: Specifies the Docker image for MySQL.
         - `environment`: Sets environment variables for MySQL.
         - `volumes`: Defines a volume for persistent data storage.
         - `networks`: Connects the service to the same network as the `web` service.
     - `volumes`: Defines named volumes for persistent storage.
     - `networks`: Defines custom networks for service communication.

4. **Testing**:
   - Use Docker Compose commands to manage your application:
     - **Build and Start Containers**: `docker-compose up --build`
     - **Start Containers in Background**: `docker-compose up -d`
     - **Stop Containers**: `docker-compose down`
   - Verify that all services are running and can communicate with each other.
   - Access the web application through the exposed ports and verify that it can connect to the database.

### Possible Improvements

- **Scaling Services**: Use Docker Compose to scale services (e.g., run multiple instances of the web service).
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Create different Docker Compose files for different environments (e.g., development, production).
- **Health Checks**: Add health checks to ensure that services are healthy before starting dependent services.
- **Custom Networks**: Use multiple custom networks to isolate services and control communication between them.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose. This skill is crucial for deploying and managing complex applications in a consistent and efficient manner. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
