# Backend Challenge - Recipe API

## Introduction

The "Recipe API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows management of recipes, including CRUD operations for recipes, ingredients, and categories.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on recipes, ingredients, and categories.
- Handle recipe details (e.g., title, description, ingredients, instructions).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing recipes.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for recipes (`/recipes`), ingredients (`/ingredients`), and categories (`/categories`):
     - `GET /recipes`: Retrieve all recipes.
     - `POST /recipes`: Create a new recipe.
     - `GET /recipes/{recipeId}`: Retrieve details about a specific recipe.
     - `PUT /recipes/{recipeId}`: Update an existing recipe.
     - `DELETE /recipes/{recipeId}`: Delete a recipe.
     - `GET /ingredients`: Retrieve all ingredients.
     - `POST /ingredients`: Create a new ingredient.
     - `GET /ingredients/{ingredientId}`: Retrieve details about a specific ingredient.
     - `PUT /ingredients/{ingredientId}`: Update an existing ingredient.
     - `DELETE /ingredients/{ingredientId}`: Delete an ingredient.
     - `GET /categories`: Retrieve all categories.
     - `POST /categories`: Create a new category.
     - `GET /categories/{categoryId}`: Retrieve details about a specific category.
     - `PUT /categories/{categoryId}`: Update an existing category.
     - `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}`: Delete a category.
   - Implement logic to interact with recipe, ingredient, and category data (e.g., store in database).
   - Include fields such as recipe title, description, ingredients list, instructions, and category associations.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/recipes`, `/ingredients`, `/categories`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating recipes, ingredients, categories).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for recipes by title, ingredients, or categories.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing recipes, ingredients, and categories.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests or when data is not found.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving sensitive operations like creating, updating, or deleting recipes.
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to validate API functionality and data interactions.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Recipe API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
