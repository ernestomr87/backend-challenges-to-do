# Backend Challenge - Inventory Management API

## Introduction

The "Inventory Management API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows management of products, categories, orders, and potentially user accounts.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on products, categories, and orders.
- Handle inventory management (e.g., stock tracking, order fulfillment).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing inventory.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for products (`/products`), categories (`/categories`), and orders (`/orders`):
     - `GET /products`: Retrieve all products.
     - `POST /products`: Create a new product.
     - `GET /products/{productId}`: Retrieve details about a specific product.
     - `PUT /products/{productId}`: Update an existing product.
     - `DELETE /products/{productId}`: Delete a product.
     - `GET /categories`: Retrieve all categories.
     - `POST /categories`: Create a new category.
     - `GET /categories/{categoryId}`: Retrieve details about a specific category.
     - `PUT /categories/{categoryId}`: Update an existing category.
     - `DELETE /categories/{categoryId}`: Delete a category.
     - `GET /orders`: Retrieve all orders.
     - `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
     - `GET /orders/{orderId}`: Retrieve details about a specific order.
     - `PUT /orders/{orderId}`: Update an existing order (e.g., change order status).
     - `DELETE /orders/{orderId}`: Cancel an order.
   - Implement logic to interact with product, category, and order data (e.g., store in database, manage stock levels).
   - Include fields such as product name, description, price, category associations, and order details.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/products`, `/categories`, `/orders`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating products, categories, orders).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Inventory Management**: Implement functionality for tracking stock levels, managing inventory, and handling order fulfillment.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving sensitive operations like creating, updating, or deleting products, categories, or orders.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests or when data is not found.
- **Reporting**: Add support for generating reports on inventory levels, sales, and orders.
- **Integration**: Integrate with payment gateways for processing orders and handling payments.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing an Inventory Management API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.
