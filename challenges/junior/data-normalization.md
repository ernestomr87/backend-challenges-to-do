# Backend Challenge - Data Normalization Service

## Introduction

The "Data Normalization Service" challenge focuses on developing an API service that standardizes and cleanses data to ensure consistency and efficiency in data processing.

### Objectives

- Understand the importance of data normalization in database management.
- Implement algorithms and techniques for data standardization.
- Ensure data integrity and accuracy through normalization processes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a service that normalizes incoming data to a predefined structure or format.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Endpoints**:
     - Define an endpoint (`/normalize`) that accepts data via HTTP POST requests and returns the normalized data.
   - **Data Normalization**:
     - Implement algorithms to cleanse and standardize data (e.g., removing duplicates, converting data types, enforcing constraints).
     - Ensure that the normalized data adheres to a specified schema or format.
   - **Validation**:
     - Validate incoming data to ensure it meets required criteria before normalization.
     - Handle edge cases and exceptions gracefully.

4. **Testing**: Test your service using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send POST requests to the `/normalize` endpoint with different data inputs and verify that the response contains the normalized data.

### Possible Improvements

- **Integration with Databases**: Extend the service to integrate with databases for storing and retrieving normalized data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize algorithms and data processing techniques for better performance.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for invalid data inputs or normalization failures.
- **Versioning**: Consider versioning the API to manage changes in data normalization logic over time.
- **Scalability**: Design the service architecture to handle large volumes of data and scale as needed.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a data normalization service and learn essential practices for maintaining data quality and consistency in backend systems. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
