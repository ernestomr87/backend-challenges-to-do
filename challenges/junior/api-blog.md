# Backend Challenge - Blog API

## Introduction

The "Blog API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows users to manage blog posts, comments, and potentially user accounts.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on blog posts and comments.
- Handle user authentication and authorization (optional).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing blog posts and comments.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for blog posts (`/posts`) and comments (`/posts/{postId}/comments`):
     - `GET /posts`: Retrieve all blog posts.
     - `POST /posts`: Create a new blog post.
     - `GET /posts/{postId}`: Retrieve a specific blog post by ID.
     - `PUT /posts/{postId}`: Update an existing blog post.
     - `DELETE /posts/{postId}`: Delete a blog post.
     - `GET /posts/{postId}/comments`: Retrieve comments for a specific blog post.
     - `POST /posts/{postId}/comments`: Add a new comment to a blog post.
   - Implement logic to interact with blog post and comment data (e.g., store in database).
   - Optionally, implement user authentication and authorization for managing blog content.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/posts`, `/posts/{postId}/comments`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating blog posts, comments).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing blog posts and comments.
- **Validation**: Validate input data to ensure blog posts and comments meet expected criteria (e.g., required fields).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests.
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving user authentication and authorization.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses for better performance.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Blog API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
