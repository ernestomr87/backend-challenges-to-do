# Backend Challenge - Email Service API

## Introduction

The "Email Service API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows users to send emails programmatically.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for sending emails with customizable content and recipients.
- Handle email templates and attachments (optional).
- Understand HTTP methods (POST) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for sending emails.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define an endpoint (`POST /send-email`) to send emails:
     - `POST /send-email`: Send an email with provided content (e.g., subject, body, recipients).
   - Implement logic to interact with email sending service or library (e.g., SMTP server, third-party email API).
   - Allow customization of email content such as subject, body (plain text or HTML), and recipients.
   - Optionally, support email templates (e.g., handlebars templates) and attachments (e.g., PDFs, images).

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send POST requests to the `/send-email` endpoint with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON with subject, body, recipients).
   - Verify that emails are sent successfully and handle error responses appropriately.

### Possible Improvements

- **Email Templates**: Implement support for predefined email templates to streamline email creation.
- **Attachment Handling**: Enhance functionality to support attachments such as files or images.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving email sending capabilities.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track email sending activities for debugging and analytics.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and manage email sending limits.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing an Email Service API and learn essential practices for backend development related to email communication. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
