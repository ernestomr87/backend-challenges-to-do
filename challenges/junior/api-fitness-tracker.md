# Backend Challenge - Fitness Tracker API

## Introduction

The "Fitness Tracker API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows users to track fitness-related data, including activities, workouts, and potentially nutrition.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on user profiles, activities, workouts, and nutrition (optional).
- Handle data related to fitness tracking (e.g., steps, distance, calories burned).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for tracking fitness data.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for user profiles (`/users`):
        - `GET /users`: Retrieve all user profiles.
        - `POST /users`: Create a new user profile.
        - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieve details about a specific user profile.
        - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Update an existing user profile.
        - `DELETE /users/{userId}`: Delete a user profile.

    - Define endpoints for activities (`/activities`):
        - `GET /activities`: Retrieve all activities.
        - `POST /activities`: Log a new activity (e.g., running, cycling).
        - `GET /activities/{activityId}`: Retrieve details about a specific activity.
        - `PUT /activities/{activityId}`: Update an existing activity.
        - `DELETE /activities/{activityId}`: Delete an activity.
    
    - Define endpoints for workouts (`/workouts`):
        - `GET /workouts`: Retrieve all workouts.
        - `POST /workouts`: Log a new workout session (e.g., gym session, yoga class).
        - `GET /workouts/{workoutId}`: Retrieve details about a specific workout.
        - `PUT /workouts/{workoutId}`: Update an existing workout.
        - `DELETE /workouts/{workoutId}`: Delete a workout.
    
    - Define endpoints for nutrition (`/nutrition`):
        - `GET /nutrition`: Retrieve nutrition logs.
        - `POST /nutrition`: Log nutrition intake (optional).
        - `GET /nutrition/{nutritionId}`: Retrieve details about a specific nutrition log.
        - `PUT /nutrition/{nutritionId}`: Update an existing nutrition log.
        - `DELETE /nutrition/{nutritionId}`: Delete a nutrition log.
   - Implement logic to interact with user profile, activity, workout, and nutrition data (e.g., store in database, calculate statistics).
   - Include fields such as user information, activity type, workout details, nutrition intake, and associated metrics.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/users`, `/activities`, `/workouts`, `/nutrition`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating user profiles, activities, workouts).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Fitness Metrics**: Implement functionality to calculate and store fitness metrics (e.g., calories burned, distance covered).
- **Dashboard**: Create a user dashboard to visualize fitness progress and statistics.
- **Integration**: Integrate with fitness tracking devices or apps to automatically log activities and workouts.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving user profiles or sensitive fitness data.
- **Goal Tracking**: Add support for users to set and track fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Fitness Tracker API and learn essential practices for backend development in the context of health and fitness applications. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
