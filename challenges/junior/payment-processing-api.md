# Backend Challenge - Payment Processing API

## Introduction

The "Payment Processing API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows users to process payments, handle refunds, and manage subscriptions programmatically.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for processing payments, refunds, and managing subscriptions.
- Handle different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
- Understand HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for payment processing.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for payment processing:
     - `POST /process-payment`: Process a payment with provided details (e.g., amount, payment method, customer information).
     - `POST /refund-payment`: Initiate a refund for a previous payment.
     - `POST /create-subscription`: Set up a subscription for recurring payments.
     - `GET /subscriptions`: Retrieve details about active subscriptions.
     - `PUT /update-subscription/{subscriptionId}`: Update an existing subscription (e.g., change plan, update payment method).
     - `DELETE /cancel-subscription/{subscriptionId}`: Cancel an active subscription.
   - Implement logic to interact with payment gateway APIs or libraries (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for processing payments and managing subscriptions.
   - Handle transactional operations securely and ensure compliance with payment industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS).

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/process-payment`, `/refund-payment`, `/create-subscription`, `/subscriptions`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON with payment details, subscription information).
   - Verify that payments are processed successfully, refunds are initiated correctly, and subscription operations behave as expected.

### Possible Improvements

- **Payment Method Support**: Implement support for various payment methods beyond credit cards (e.g., digital wallets, bank transfers).
- **Webhooks**: Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about payment events (e.g., successful payments, subscription renewals).
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving sensitive payment information.
- **Reporting**: Add support for generating reports on payment transactions, refunds, and subscription metrics.
- **Integration**: Integrate with e-commerce platforms or accounting systems to synchronize payment data.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Payment Processing API and learn essential practices for backend development related to financial transactions and subscription management. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
