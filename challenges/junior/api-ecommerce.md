# Backend Challenge - Basic E-commerce API

## Introduction

The "Basic E-commerce API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows basic management of products, orders, and potentially user accounts.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on products and orders.
- Handle user authentication and authorization (optional).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing products and orders in an e-commerce system.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for products (`/products`) and orders (`/orders`):
     - `GET /products`: Retrieve all products.
     - `POST /products`: Create a new product.
     - `GET /products/{productId}`: Retrieve a specific product by ID.
     - `PUT /products/{productId}`: Update an existing product.
     - `DELETE /products/{productId}`: Delete a product.
     - `GET /orders`: Retrieve all orders.
     - `POST /orders`: Create a new order.
     - `GET /orders/{orderId}`: Retrieve a specific order by ID.
     - `PUT /orders/{orderId}`: Update an existing order (e.g., change status).
     - `DELETE /orders/{orderId}`: Cancel an order.
   - Implement logic to interact with product and order data (e.g., store in database).
   - Optionally, implement user authentication and authorization for managing orders.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/products`, `/orders`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating products, orders).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Validation**: Implement validation for input data (e.g., required fields, product pricing).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests.
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving user authentication and authorization.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries and API responses for better performance, especially under high load.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate with a payment gateway for processing orders.
