# Backend Challenge - Event Scheduling API

## Introduction

The "Event Scheduling API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows management of events, including CRUD operations.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on events.
- Handle event details (e.g., title, description, start/end time).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing events.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for events (`/events`):
     - `GET /events`: Retrieve all events.
     - `POST /events`: Create a new event.
     - `GET /events/{eventId}`: Retrieve a specific event by ID.
     - `PUT /events/{eventId}`: Update an existing event.
     - `DELETE /events/{eventId}`: Delete an event.
   - Implement logic to interact with event data (e.g., store in database).
   - Include fields such as event title, description, start time, end time, and location.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/events`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating events).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Validation**: Implement validation for input data (e.g., required fields, date/time formats).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests.
- **Timezone Support**: Add support for different timezones when scheduling events.
- **Attendees**: Extend the API to support managing event attendees and RSVPs.
- **Recurrence**: Implement recurring events (e.g., daily, weekly) for more advanced scheduling.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing an Event Scheduling API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
