# Backend Challenge - Movie Database API

## Introduction

The "Movie Database API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that provides access to movie information, including details about movies, actors, directors, and reviews.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for retrieving movie details, actors, directors, and reviews.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
- Integrate with a movie database or API provider (e.g., IMDb, The Movie Database).

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for accessing movie information.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for movie information (`/movies`), actors (`/actors`), directors (`/directors`), and reviews (`/movies/{movieId}/reviews`):
     - `GET /movies`: Retrieve a list of movies.
     - `GET /movies/{movieId}`: Retrieve details about a specific movie.
     - `GET /actors`: Retrieve a list of actors.
     - `GET /actors/{actorId}`: Retrieve details about a specific actor.
     - `GET /directors`: Retrieve a list of directors.
     - `GET /directors/{directorId}`: Retrieve details about a specific director.
     - `GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews`: Retrieve reviews for a specific movie.
   - Integrate with a movie database or API provider to fetch movie data.
   - Parse the response from the movie database or API provider and return relevant information as JSON.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/movies`, `/actors`, `/directors`, `/movies/{movieId}/reviews`) to retrieve movie data.
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK).

### Possible Improvements

- **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for movies by title, actors, or genres.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing movies, actors, and directors.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests or when movie data is not found.
- **Additional Movie Data**: Extend the API to include additional movie data such as trailers, ratings, and production details.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Movie Database API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
