# Backend Challenge - Notification Service

## Introduction

The "Notification Service" challenge is designed to build a REST API that allows users to manage and send notifications programmatically.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for sending notifications to users via various channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications).
- Handle different types of notifications (e.g., alerts, reminders, updates).
- Understand HTTP methods (POST) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a REST API that provides functionality for managing and sending notifications.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for sending notifications:
     - `POST /send-notification`: Send a notification with customizable content (e.g., message, recipient, notification type).
   - Implement logic to interact with notification services or libraries (e.g., email service, SMS gateway, push notification provider).
   - Allow customization of notification content such as message, recipient(s), notification type (e.g., alert, reminder).
   - Support multiple notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) based on user preferences or system settings.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send POST requests to the `/send-notification` endpoint with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON with message, recipient, notification type).
   - Verify that notifications are sent successfully and handle error responses appropriately.

### Possible Improvements

- **Template Support**: Implement support for predefined notification templates to streamline notification creation.
- **Multi-language Support**: Enhance functionality to support notifications in multiple languages.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving notification sending capabilities.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to track notification sending activities for debugging and analytics.
- **Batch Notifications**: Add support for sending batch notifications to multiple recipients at once.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Notification System API and learn essential practices for backend development related to communication and notification delivery. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
