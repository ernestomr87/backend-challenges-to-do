# Backend Challenge - Task Management API

## Introduction

The "Task Management API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows management of tasks, including CRUD operations.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
- Handle task statuses (e.g., pending, completed).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing tasks.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for tasks (`/tasks`):
     - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
     - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
     - `GET /tasks/{taskId}`: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
     - `PUT /tasks/{taskId}`: Update an existing task.
     - `DELETE /tasks/{taskId}`: Delete a task.
   - Implement logic to interact with task data (e.g., store in database).
   - Include fields such as task name, description, status, and due date.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/tasks`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating tasks).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Validation**: Implement validation for input data (e.g., required fields, date formats).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing tasks, especially if the number of tasks grows.
- **Task Assignments**: Extend the API to support assigning tasks to users.
- **Reminders**: Implement reminder functionality for tasks with due dates.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Task Management API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
