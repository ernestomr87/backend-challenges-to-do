# Backend Challenge - Cryptography Service

## Introduction

The "Cryptography Service" challenge is designed to build a service that provides encryption and decryption functionalities, ensuring data security through cryptographic techniques.

### Objectives

- Understand basic cryptographic concepts.
- Implement encryption and decryption functionalities.
- Secure sensitive data in a backend application.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a service that offers encryption and decryption of data using a chosen cryptographic algorithm (e.g., AES, RSA).

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Endpoints**:
     - Define an endpoint (`/encrypt`) that accepts data via HTTP POST requests and returns the encrypted data.
     - Define an endpoint (`/decrypt`) that accepts encrypted data via HTTP POST requests and returns the decrypted data.
   - **Encryption and Decryption**:
     - Implement encryption using a secure algorithm (e.g., AES for symmetric encryption, RSA for asymmetric encryption).
     - Implement decryption to reverse the encryption process and retrieve the original data.
   - **Key Management**:
     - Securely generate and manage encryption keys.
     - Store keys in a secure manner (e.g., environment variables, key management service).

4. **Testing**: Test your service using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send POST requests to the `/encrypt` endpoint with different data inputs and verify that the response contains the encrypted data.
   - Send POST requests to the `/decrypt` endpoint with the encrypted data and verify that the response contains the original data.

### Possible Improvements

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization to control access to the encryption and decryption endpoints.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring to track encryption and decryption activities.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Extend the service to support multiple cryptographic algorithms and allow clients to choose.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the encryption and decryption processes for better performance.
- **Key Rotation**: Implement key rotation mechanisms to periodically change encryption keys.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a cryptography service and learn essential practices for securing data in a backend application. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
