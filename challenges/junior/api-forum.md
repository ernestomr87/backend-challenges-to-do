# Backend Challenge - Forum API

## Introduction

The "Forum API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows management of forums, threads, posts, and potentially user accounts.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on forums, threads, and posts.
- Handle user authentication and authorization (optional).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for managing forums, threads, and posts.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints for forums (`/forums`), threads (`/forums/{forumId}/threads`), and posts (`/threads/{threadId}/posts`):
     - `GET /forums`: Retrieve all forums.
     - `POST /forums`: Create a new forum.
     - `GET /forums/{forumId}`: Retrieve details about a specific forum.
     - `PUT /forums/{forumId}`: Update an existing forum.
     - `DELETE /forums/{forumId}`: Delete a forum.
     - `GET /forums/{forumId}/threads`: Retrieve all threads in a forum.
     - `POST /forums/{forumId}/threads`: Create a new thread in a forum.
     - `GET /threads/{threadId}`: Retrieve details about a specific thread.
     - `PUT /threads/{threadId}`: Update an existing thread.
     - `DELETE /threads/{threadId}`: Delete a thread.
     - `GET /threads/{threadId}/posts`: Retrieve all posts in a thread.
     - `POST /threads/{threadId}/posts`: Create a new post in a thread.
     - `GET /posts/{postId}`: Retrieve details about a specific post.
     - `PUT /posts/{postId}`: Update an existing post.
     - `DELETE /posts/{postId}`: Delete a post.
   - Implement logic to interact with forum, thread, and post data (e.g., store in database).
   - Include fields such as forum title, thread subject, post content, and user associations.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/forums`, `/forums/{forumId}/threads`, `/threads/{threadId}/posts`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating forums, threads, posts).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for listing forums, threads, and posts.
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for invalid requests or when data is not found.
- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints, especially those involving user operations like creating, updating, or deleting forums, threads, or posts.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement search functionality to allow users to search for forums, threads, or posts by title or content.
- **Notifications**: Add support for notifications when new posts are added to subscribed threads.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Forum API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
