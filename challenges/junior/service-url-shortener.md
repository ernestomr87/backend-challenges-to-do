# Backend Challenge - URL Shortener Service

## Introduction

The "URL Shortener Service" challenge involves building an API that shortens long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.

### Objectives

- Develop an understanding of URL shortening techniques and algorithms.
- Implement a service that generates short URLs from long ones.
- Ensure redirection from short URLs to original long URLs.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Create an API service that converts long URLs into short URLs and handles redirection.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Endpoints**:
     - Define an endpoint (`/shorten`) that accepts long URLs via HTTP POST requests and returns a shortened URL.
     - Define an endpoint (`/{shortCode}`) that handles redirection to the original long URL when accessed via GET requests.
   - **URL Shortening**:
     - Implement algorithms (e.g., Base62 encoding) to generate short codes from long URLs.
     - Ensure uniqueness of short codes to avoid collisions and maintain integrity.
   - **Redirection**:
     - Implement logic to redirect users from short URLs to their corresponding long URLs.
   
4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Use the `/shorten` endpoint to generate short URLs from different long URLs.
   - Access the `/shortCode` endpoint with generated short codes to verify redirection to original long URLs.

### Possible Improvements

- **Analytics**: Track usage statistics such as click counts and geographical data for shortened URLs.
- **Custom URLs**: Allow users to specify custom short URLs for specific long URLs.
- **Expiration**: Implement expiration policies for short URLs to automatically disable or delete them after a certain period.
- **Security**: Enhance security measures to prevent misuse or abuse of the shortening service.
- **API Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers to integrate the URL shortener service into their applications.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a URL shortener service and learn essential practices for handling URL management and redirection in backend systems. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
