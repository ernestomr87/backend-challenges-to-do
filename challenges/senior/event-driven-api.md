# Backend Challenge - Event-Driven Architecture API

## Introduction

The "Event-Driven Architecture API" challenge focuses on building a RESTful API that enables event-driven communication and processing within your application.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests for event registration, processing, and notification.
- Implement endpoints for publishing and subscribing to events.
- Support reliable event delivery, event routing, and handling of event-driven workflows.
- Understand HTTP methods (POST, GET) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop an Event-Driven Architecture API that facilitates event-driven communication and processing.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `POST /events`: Publish an event to the event bus.
     - `GET /events/{eventId}`: Retrieve details about a specific event.
     - `POST /subscriptions`: Subscribe to events based on specific criteria (e.g., event type, topic).
     - `DELETE /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: Unsubscribe from events.
   - Implement support for event sourcing and event-driven workflows:
     - Use message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for reliable event delivery and processing.
     - Handle event serialization, deserialization, and schema evolution.
     - Implement mechanisms for event replay and dead-letter handling.
   - Ensure fault tolerance and error handling for event processing and subscription management.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to event endpoints.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Publish events and verify their delivery and processing.
   - Subscribe to events and validate event propagation and handling.
   - Test error scenarios such as event duplication or subscription failures.
   - Validate API responses include appropriate status codes and error handling for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Event Orchestration**: Implement workflows and state machines based on event-driven triggers.
- **Event Monitoring**: Integrate with monitoring tools to track event throughput and latency.
- **Event Replay**: Provide mechanisms to replay events for debugging or analytics purposes.
- **Integration**: Integrate with third-party event-driven platforms (e.g., AWS EventBridge, Azure Event Grid) for interoperability.
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Develop dashboards to visualize event streams and processing metrics.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing an Event-Driven Architecture API and learn essential practices for backend development related to event-driven communication and processing. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
