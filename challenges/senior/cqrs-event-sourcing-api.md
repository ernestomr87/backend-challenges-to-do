# Backend Challenge - CQRS and Event Sourcing API

## Introduction

The "CQRS and Event Sourcing API" challenge focuses on building an API that implements the CQRS pattern for separating command (write) and query (read) responsibilities, along with event sourcing for data persistence and state management.

### Objectives

- Design and implement commands and queries for manipulating and retrieving data.
- Implement event sourcing to capture and persist domain events as the primary source of truth.
- Support scalability, consistency, and resilience through CQRS and event sourcing patterns.
- Understand CQRS, event sourcing principles, and their practical applications.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a CQRS and Event Sourcing API that demonstrates separation of concerns between write and read operations, and uses event sourcing for data persistence.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language and frameworks for implementing CQRS and event sourcing patterns (e.g., Axon Framework, Eventuate).

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - **Commands and Queries**:
     - Define commands for write operations that change the application state (e.g., create, update, delete).
     - Implement queries for read operations that retrieve data from the event store or read models.
   - **Event Sourcing**:
     - Design event classes to represent domain events that capture state changes (e.g., OrderCreatedEvent, OrderUpdatedEvent).
     - Implement event handlers to process events and update aggregate state and projections.
     - Store events in an event store or database to maintain a sequential record of changes.
   - **Command Handlers**:
     - Implement command handlers to validate commands and apply domain logic.
     - Persist resulting events to the event store and publish them to event subscribers or projections.
   - **Query Handlers**:
     - Implement query handlers to retrieve data from read models or materialized views.
     - Optimize read operations for performance and scalability using appropriate data storage solutions.
   - **Integration**:
     - Integrate with messaging systems or event buses for event-driven communication between components.
     - Implement sagas or process managers for coordinating long-running transactions and maintaining consistency.
   
4. **Testing**: Test your CQRS and event sourcing API using unit tests and integration tests.
   - Validate command execution and event handling logic.
   - Test query responses and data consistency across read models and projections.
   - Perform load testing to evaluate system performance under varying transaction volumes and concurrency.

### Possible Improvements

- **Snapshotting**: Implement snapshotting to optimize read model performance and reduce event store size.
- **Event Replaying**: Provide mechanisms to replay events for auditing, debugging, or rebuilding state.
- **Concurrency Control**: Implement optimistic or pessimistic locking strategies to handle concurrent command processing.
- **Event Versioning**: Manage event schema evolution and backward compatibility to ensure long-term data integrity.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Integrate with monitoring tools to track event processing metrics and performance.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain advanced experience in designing and implementing a CQRS and Event Sourcing API, essential for building scalable and resilient backend systems. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills in event-driven architecture and distributed systems.

Happy coding!
