# Backend Challenge - Distributed Tracing API

## Introduction

The "Distributed Tracing API" challenge focuses on building an API that facilitates distributed tracing for monitoring and analyzing requests across a microservices architecture.

### Objectives

- Implement distributed tracing to track request flow and latency across distributed components.
- Design and instrument APIs to generate and propagate trace context through requests.
- Support visualization and analysis of distributed traces for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
- Understand distributed tracing principles, instrumentation, and integration.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a Distributed Tracing API that enables monitoring and tracing of requests through a distributed system.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred distributed tracing system or framework (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, AWS X-Ray) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - **Instrumentation**:
     - Integrate distributed tracing libraries or SDKs into your APIs to generate trace spans and propagate trace context.
     - Instrument endpoints and middleware to capture trace data (e.g., HTTP headers, correlation IDs).
   - **Trace Propagation**:
     - Implement mechanisms to propagate trace context across services using standard protocols (e.g., HTTP headers, message headers).
     - Ensure trace context is passed through asynchronous and event-driven communication (e.g., message queues, pub/sub systems).
   - **Data Collection and Storage**:
     - Configure data collectors to receive trace data and store it in a trace repository (e.g., Elasticsearch, Amazon DynamoDB).
     - Define retention policies and data aggregation methods for efficient trace storage and querying.
   - **Visualization and Analysis**:
     - Integrate with tracing visualization tools or dashboards to view distributed traces and analyze request flow.
     - Use trace analysis features to identify performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and dependencies.
   - **Integration**:
     - Integrate with microservices architecture components (e.g., API gateways, service meshes) for comprehensive trace coverage.
     - Ensure compatibility with cloud-native services and orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS).

4. **Testing**: Test your Distributed Tracing API using sample requests and scenarios.
   - Generate synthetic requests and validate trace propagation and visualization.
   - Monitor trace data for completeness, accuracy, and alignment with expected service interactions.
   - Evaluate trace analysis capabilities for identifying and resolving performance issues.

### Possible Improvements

- **Advanced Trace Analysis**: Implement anomaly detection and predictive analytics based on trace data patterns.
- **Contextual Logging**: Integrate trace context with logging frameworks for enriched log analysis and correlation.
- **Distributed Context Management**: Enhance trace context propagation with context propagation libraries (e.g., OpenTelemetry).
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement real-time trace monitoring and alerting for immediate issue identification.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize trace data collection and storage for minimal overhead and efficient resource usage.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in designing and implementing a Distributed Tracing API, crucial for monitoring and optimizing performance across distributed microservices architectures. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills in observability and distributed systems.

Happy coding!
