# Backend Challenge - User Registration and Login API

## Introduction

The "User Registration and Login API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that manages user authentication, including registration and login functionalities.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for user registration, login, and potentially logout.
- Store user data securely (e.g., hashed passwords).
- Understand HTTP methods (POST for sending data) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that supports user registration and login.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/logout` if needed) for user management:
     - `POST /register`: Create a new user account.
     - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and generate an access token.
     - `POST /logout` (optional): Invalidate the user's current session or access token.
   - Implement logic to securely store user credentials (e.g., using hashing algorithms like bcrypt).
   - Return appropriate responses (e.g., access tokens for successful login, error messages for failed attempts).

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/register`, `/login`, `/logout`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for registration, login credentials).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected data (e.g., access tokens) and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized).

### Possible Improvements

- **Password Policies**: Implement password complexity rules (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
- **Token Management**: Enhance token management with expiration dates and refresh tokens.
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and responses for better user experience.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Extend the API to support different user roles and access levels.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a user authentication API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
