# Backend Challenge - Zip Code Lookup Service

## Introduction

The "Zip Code Lookup Service" challenge is designed to create a RESTful API that retrieves location information based on zip codes.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints to look up location details based on zip codes.
- Integrate with an external API or use a dataset for location information.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that returns location information (e.g., city, state, country) based on a given zip code.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Define endpoints for handling zip code lookups:
     - `GET /lookup?zip={zip_code}`: Retrieve location information for the provided zip code.
       - Example: `GET /lookup?zip=90210` should return `{"city": "Beverly Hills", "state": "CA", "country": "USA"}`.
   - Implement logic to interact with location data:
     - Use an external API (e.g., Zipcodebase, Zippopotam.us) to fetch location details, or use a local dataset if an external API is not available.
     - Return location details as JSON in the response, including city, state/province, and country.
   - Ensure proper error handling for invalid or non-existent zip codes.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using an HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to the `/lookup` endpoint with various valid and invalid zip codes.
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected location data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Reverse Lookup**: Add an endpoint that allows users to retrieve zip codes based on city and state.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently looked-up zip codes to reduce external API calls and improve performance.
- **Autocomplete Feature**: Provide suggestions for locations as users type in the zip code (useful for building a UI).
- **Multi-Country Support**: Expand the service to support zip codes from multiple countries.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service, especially if using a free tier of an external API.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a zip code lookup service and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
