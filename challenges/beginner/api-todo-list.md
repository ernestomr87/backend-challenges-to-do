# Backend Challenge - Simple TODO List API

## Introduction

The "Simple TODO List API" challenge is designed to build a RESTful API that allows users to manage a list of tasks.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- Store tasks persistently (e.g., in-memory, database).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that manages a TODO list of tasks.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints (`/tasks`) for handling CRUD operations:
     - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
     - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
     - `GET /tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
     - `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Update an existing task.
     - `DELETE /tasks/{id}`: Delete a task by ID.
   - Implement logic to interact with task data (e.g., store tasks in memory, use a database).
   - Return task data as JSON in responses.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Send requests to each endpoint (`/tasks`) with appropriate data payloads (e.g., JSON for creating/updating tasks).
   - Verify that the responses contain the expected task data and that status codes are appropriate (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

### Possible Improvements

- **Authentication**: Add user authentication to secure the API endpoints.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for `GET /tasks` endpoint to handle large datasets.
- **Validation**: Validate input data to ensure task properties meet expected criteria (e.g., task description length).
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error messages and responses for better user experience.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Add capabilities to sort and filter tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date, status).

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a basic TODO list API and learn essential practices for backend development. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
