# Backend Challenge - Distributed Caching System API

## Introduction

The "Distributed Caching System API" challenge focuses on building a RESTful API that allows users to manage distributed caching for improved performance and scalability of applications.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests for caching operations.
- Implement endpoints for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting cached data.
- Support distributed caching strategies for handling high-volume data access.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a Distributed Caching System API that provides functionality for managing cached data.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `PUT /cache/{key}`: Store data in the cache with a specified key.
     - `GET /cache/{key}`: Retrieve data from the cache based on the key.
     - `POST /cache/{key}`: Update existing data in the cache with a specified key.
     - `DELETE /cache/{key}`: Delete data from the cache based on the key.
   - Implement support for distributed caching strategies:
     - Choose a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis, Memcached) suitable for distributed environments.
     - Handle cache synchronization and consistency across multiple nodes or instances.
     - Implement caching policies such as expiration times and eviction strategies.
   - Ensure fault tolerance and error handling for cache operations and distributed environment failures.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to caching endpoints.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Store, retrieve, update, and delete cached data through API endpoints.
   - Validate cache consistency and synchronization across distributed nodes.
   - Verify API responses include appropriate status codes and error handling for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Cache Invalidation**: Implement strategies for cache invalidation based on data updates or expiration policies.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with monitoring tools to track cache performance metrics (e.g., hit rate, miss rate).
- **Encryption**: Implement data encryption for sensitive cached data.
- **Scaling**: Optimize cache performance for scalability by adding or removing cache nodes dynamically.
- **Integration**: Integrate with application frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot, Django) for seamless integration with existing systems.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Distributed Caching System API and learn essential practices for backend development related to caching and performance optimization. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
