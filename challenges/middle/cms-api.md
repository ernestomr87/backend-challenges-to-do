# Backend Challenge - Content Management System (CMS) API

## Introduction

The "Content Management System (CMS) API" challenge focuses on building a RESTful API that supports creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving various types of content.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for managing articles, posts, pages, media assets, and user roles.
- Handle authentication, authorization, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a CMS API that provides functionality for managing content.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - **Articles/Posts**:
       - `GET /articles`: Retrieve a list of articles/posts.
       - `GET /articles/{articleId}`: Retrieve details about a specific article/post.
       - `POST /articles`: Create a new article/post.
       - `PUT /articles/{articleId}`: Update an existing article/post.
       - `DELETE /articles/{articleId}`: Delete an article/post.
     - **Pages**:
       - `GET /pages`: Retrieve a list of pages.
       - `GET /pages/{pageId}`: Retrieve details about a specific page.
       - `POST /pages`: Create a new page.
       - `PUT /pages/{pageId}`: Update an existing page.
       - `DELETE /pages/{pageId}`: Delete a page.
     - **Media Assets**:
       - `GET /media`: Retrieve a list of media assets (images, videos, files).
       - `GET /media/{mediaId}`: Retrieve details about a specific media asset.
       - `POST /media`: Upload a new media asset.
       - `DELETE /media/{mediaId}`: Delete a media asset.
     - **User Management**:
       - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of users.
       - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieve details about a specific user.
       - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
       - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Update an existing user.
       - `DELETE /users/{userId}`: Delete a user.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth) for secure API access.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict API endpoints based on user roles (e.g., admin, editor, author).
   - Ensure data validation and error handling for API requests and responses.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Create, update, delete articles/posts, pages, media assets, and user accounts.
   - Test authentication and authorization workflows with different user roles.
   - Validate API responses include appropriate status codes and error messages for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Versioning**: Implement API versioning to manage backward compatibility with changes.
- **Search and Filtering**: Enhance content retrieval with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
- **Workflow Management**: Implement workflows for content approval, publication, and archiving.
- **Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track content performance metrics (e.g., views, engagement).
- **Integration**: Integrate with third-party services (e.g., CDN for media storage, SEO tools) for enhanced functionality.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Content Management System (CMS) API and learn essential practices for backend development related to managing diverse content types and user roles. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.
