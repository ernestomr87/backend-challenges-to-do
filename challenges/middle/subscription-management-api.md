# Backend Challenge - Subscription Management API

## Introduction

The "Subscription Management API" challenge focuses on building a RESTful API that handles subscription lifecycle management for users.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for creating, updating, canceling, and querying subscriptions.
- Handle recurring billing cycles and subscription status updates.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a Subscription Management API that provides functionality for handling subscriptions.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `POST /subscriptions`: Create a new subscription for a user.
     - `GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: Retrieve details about a specific subscription.
     - `PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: Update an existing subscription (e.g., change plan, update payment method).
     - `DELETE /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}`: Cancel a subscription.
     - `GET /subscriptions/user/{userId}`: Retrieve all subscriptions for a specific user.
   - Implement logic to manage subscription lifecycle events:
     - Handle subscription creation with initial setup and billing information.
     - Manage recurring billing cycles and payment retries.
     - Update subscription details based on user actions (e.g., plan upgrades/downgrades).
     - Cancel subscriptions and handle associated actions (e.g., end of service access).
   - Ensure secure handling of payment information and compliance with subscription billing regulations.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Create new subscriptions, update subscription details, and verify cancellation workflows.
   - Test recurring billing scenarios and ensure accurate subscription status updates.
   - Validate API responses include appropriate status codes and error handling for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Trial Periods**: Implement support for trial periods and promotional offers for subscriptions.
- **Invoice Generation**: Generate invoices or billing statements for subscription charges.
- **Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track subscription metrics (e.g., churn rate, renewal rates).
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to users for upcoming renewals, failed payments, or subscription changes.
- **Integration**: Integrate with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure payment processing and subscription management.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Subscription Management API and learn essential practices for backend development related to handling recurring billing and subscription lifecycle management. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
