# Backend Challenge - Task Scheduling API

## Introduction

The "Task Scheduling API" challenge focuses on building a RESTful API that allows users to schedule and manage tasks within your application.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests for task management and scheduling.
- Implement endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and querying tasks.
- Support recurring tasks and scheduling options.
- Understand HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a Task Scheduling API that provides functionality for managing and scheduling tasks.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
     - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve a list of tasks.
     - `GET /tasks/{taskId}`: Retrieve details about a specific task.
     - `PUT /tasks/{taskId}`: Update an existing task.
     - `DELETE /tasks/{taskId}`: Delete a task.
   - Implement support for task scheduling:
     - Define scheduling options such as one-time, recurring, or cron-based schedules.
     - Handle task execution based on scheduled intervals or specific dates/times.
     - Manage task dependencies and chaining for sequential or parallel execution.
   - Ensure fault tolerance and error handling for task execution and scheduling failures.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to task management endpoints.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Create tasks with different scheduling options (one-time, recurring) and verify their execution.
   - Retrieve task details and status to validate scheduling accuracy.
   - Validate API responses include appropriate status codes and error handling for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Task Prioritization**: Implement priority levels for tasks to manage execution order.
- **Concurrency Management**: Handle concurrent task execution and resource allocation.
- **Notification Integration**: Integrate with a notification service to alert users about task status changes.
- **Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard or monitoring interface to track task execution and scheduling.
- **Integration**: Integrate with third-party task management tools or calendars for synchronization.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Task Scheduling API and learn essential practices for backend development related to task management and scheduling. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
