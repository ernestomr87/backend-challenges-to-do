# Backend Challenge - Advanced E-commerce API

## Introduction

The "Advanced E-commerce API" challenge is designed to build a robust RESTful API that supports various features of an e-commerce platform.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling API requests.
- Implement endpoints for managing product catalogs, shopping carts, orders, payments, and user accounts.
- Handle advanced e-commerce functionalities such as product search, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
- Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a RESTful API that provides functionality for an advanced e-commerce platform.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) and set up the necessary environment.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - **Products**:
       - `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of products with filtering, sorting, and pagination options.
       - `GET /products/{productId}`: Retrieve details about a specific product.
       - `POST /products`: Create a new product.
       - `PUT /products/{productId}`: Update an existing product.
       - `DELETE /products/{productId}`: Delete a product.
     - **Shopping Cart**:
       - `GET /cart`: Retrieve the current user's shopping cart contents.
       - `POST /cart/add`: Add a product to the shopping cart.
       - `PUT /cart/update/{productId}`: Update quantity or remove a product from the shopping cart.
       - `DELETE /cart/remove/{productId}`: Remove a product from the shopping cart.
     - **Orders**:
       - `POST /orders`: Place a new order based on items in the shopping cart.
       - `GET /orders/{orderId}`: Retrieve details about a specific order.
       - `GET /orders`: Retrieve a list of orders with filtering and pagination options.
       - `PUT /orders/{orderId}/cancel`: Cancel an order.
     - **Payments**:
       - `POST /payments/initiate`: Initiate a payment for an order.
       - `POST /payments/confirm`: Confirm payment completion and update order status.
     - **Users**:
       - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieve user details.
       - `PUT /users/{userId}`: Update user information (e.g., address, payment methods).
   - Implement logic to handle product catalogs, shopping cart management, order processing, payment integration, and user authentication.
   - Utilize database operations (e.g., CRUD operations) to store and retrieve data related to products, orders, and users.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using a HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).
   - Create, update, and delete products.
   - Add products to the shopping cart, place orders, and verify order status updates.
   - Test payment initiation and confirmation workflows.
   - Ensure API responses include appropriate status codes and error handling for edge cases.

### Possible Improvements

- **Search and Filtering**: Enhance product search capabilities with keyword search, category filtering, and price range filtering.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Implement product recommendations based on user browsing history or purchase behavior.
- **Shipping Integration**: Integrate with shipping carriers to calculate shipping costs and track shipments.
- **Analytics**: Implement analytics to track sales metrics, customer behavior, and product performance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize API performance with caching strategies, database indexing, and asynchronous processing for heavy operations.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing an Advanced E-commerce API and learn essential practices for backend development in the context of e-commerce platforms. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
