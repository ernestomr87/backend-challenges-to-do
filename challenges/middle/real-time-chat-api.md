# Backend Challenge - Real-time Chat API

## Introduction

The "Real-time Chat API" challenge focuses on building a scalable and efficient backend system that supports real-time messaging between users.

### Objectives

- Set up a web server capable of handling WebSocket connections.
- Implement endpoints for managing users, conversations, and messages.
- Enable real-time updates and notifications for instant messaging.
- Understand WebSocket protocol and handling real-time events.

### Instructions

1. **Objective**: Develop a Real-time Chat API that provides functionality for instant messaging.

2. **Environment Setup**: Choose your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go) and set up the necessary environment for WebSocket support.

3. **Implementation Details**: 
   - Define endpoints:
     - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
     - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and generate a session token.
     - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
     - `GET /users/{userId}`: Retrieve details about a specific user.
     - `POST /conversations`: Start a new conversation between users.
     - `GET /conversations/{conversationId}`: Retrieve messages from a specific conversation.
     - `POST /conversations/{conversationId}/message`: Send a message to a conversation.
   - Implement WebSocket support for real-time communication:
     - Establish WebSocket connections for users to send and receive messages instantly.
     - Handle message broadcasting to update all participants in a conversation in real-time.
     - Implement presence status (e.g., online, offline) for users and notify participants about changes in user status.
   - Ensure secure WebSocket connections with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

4. **Testing**: Test your API using WebSocket clients or tools like WebSocket extensions for browsers.
   - Verify WebSocket connections for sending and receiving messages.
   - Test API endpoints for user registration, login, conversation management, and message sending.

### Possible Improvements

- **Message Encryption**: Implement end-to-end encryption for message security.
- **Message Status**: Add support for message status indicators (e.g., read receipts, message delivered).
- **Notification Integration**: Integrate with push notification services for offline message delivery.
- **Attachment Support**: Allow users to send and receive media files or attachments within messages.
- **Archiving**: Implement message archiving and retrieval for historical conversations.

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will gain practical experience in developing a Real-time Chat API and learn essential practices for backend development related to WebSocket communication and real-time messaging. Explore additional improvements and challenges to further enhance your skills.

Happy coding!
